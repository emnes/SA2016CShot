# Overview

CubeShot applies the sharing economy concept to space asset management, providing seamless access to satellite resources. We help match a user's needs with the available resources of satellite operators with the goal of democratizing access to space.

# How it works

CubeShot retrieves the metadata related to each cubesat and seamlessly integrates this information to allow the user to request an image based on their needs. A user requests imagery with certain parameters such as location, date, budget, image spatial resolution (High – sub-1m, Medium – 1-3m, Low – 3m+) and any other requirements suited to their needs. Our algorithm will then analyse the request and match it with a selection of suitable options pertaining to specific operators/satellites.

# Target Market

Currently there are numerous cubesat operators launching many satellites and developing advanced capabilities using cutting-edge technologies for earth observation. These operators are creating constellations that will take satellite imagery to a new level. Moreover, the number of cubesat operators has grown significantly since 2010 and the majority of these are Earth Observation focused (NSR 2015). With this unprecedented growth in supply, CubeShot is aiming to tackle the demand issue by making it seamless for users to access the growing trove of data and imagery that these operators will be producing.
